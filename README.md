# Azure DevOps Automation Scripts
Overview
This repository contains a collection of C# scripts designed to automate common tasks for managing Azure cloud resources. These scripts are tailored for DevOps engineers and aim to streamline deployment, monitoring, and maintenance processes within Azure environments.

Features
Automated deployment of Azure resources using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.
Monitoring setup and configuration for Azure services using Azure Monitor.
Automated scaling of Azure resources based on predefined criteria.
Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline setup using Azure DevOps.

# In this rewritten code:

The DeployApplicationToAzureAsync() method deploys an application to an Azure virtual machine (VM) using the Azure Management Libraries for .NET.
The MonitorAzureVMStatus() method monitors the status of the Azure VM.
The script assumes that you have already set up Azure service principal credentials with appropriate permissions and replaced placeholders (e.g., <your-tenant-id>, <your-client-id>, <your-client-secret>, <your-subscription-id>, <admin-username>, <admin-password>, <your-custom-script>, <your-network-interface-id>, <your-resource-group-name>, <your-vm-name>) with your actual Azure configuration details.
